-- Approach 1
-- Na√¨ve Approach

SELECT TOP 1 Salary
FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT TOP N Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      ) AS Emp
ORDER BY Salary


-- Approach 2
-- My SQL
SELECT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT n-1,1


-- Approach 3 (Same as Approach 2)
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M = N-1;
  RETURN (
      select DISTINCT salary from Employee order by salary desc limit M, 1
  );
END

select

      from 
            Employee
