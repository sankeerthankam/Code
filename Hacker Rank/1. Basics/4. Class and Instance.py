'''In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance;
because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages.
Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initial_age, as a parameter.
The constructor must assign initial_age to _age after confirming the argument passed as _initial_age is not negative.
If a negative argument is passed as initial_age, the constructor should set to and print "Age is not valid, setting age to 0."
In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
	age_1_year() should increase the instance variable _age by 1.
	is_old() should perform the following conditional actions:
		If age < 13, print "You are young.".
		If age >= 13 and age < 18, print "You are a teenager.".
		Otherwise, print "You are old.".

    # Add some more code to run some checks on initial_age
    def __init__(self, initial_age):
        if initial_age < 0:
            print("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
            self._age = 0
        else:
            self._age = initial_age

    # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console

        if self._age < 13:

        elif (13 <= self._age) and (self._age < 18):
            print("You are a teenager.")
        else:
            print("You are old.")

    # Increment the age of the person in here
