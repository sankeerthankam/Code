# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
# Example 1:
# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]


# Explanation:
# There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
# The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
    res = defaultdict(list)
    for word in strs:
        c_counts = [0] * 26
        for char in word:
            c_counts[ord(char) - ord("a")] += 1
        res[tuple(c_counts)].append(word)
        # print(res)
    return list(res.values())

# Why use tuples as keys instead of lists?
# No, lists cannot be used as keys in Python dictionaries.
# This restriction arises because dictionary keys must be hashable, meaning they must have a hash value that remains constant throughout their lifetime. 
# Lists are mutable objects, which means their contents can be changed after they are created. 
# If a list were used as a key and then modified, its hash value would change, making it impossible for the dictionary to efficiently locate the corresponding value.

# Complexity
# Time complexity: O(m∗n)
    # m is number of words in the string and n is number of characters in each string
# Space complexity: O(mn)
